He seems to draw inspiration from multiple disciplines like card games, psychology, history, sciences, etc. One of my main takeaways from this book has been being multi-disciplinary, and building a latticework of mental models and hang your experience in there.<br/><br/>Some important points listed here: https://fs.blog/munger-worldly-wisdom/<br/><br/>———————<br/><br/>Currently at 1/3rd progress, thought to review the good parts lest I forget.<br/><br/>The first two chapters (not written by Charlie Munger) is a compilation of opinion of Charlier Munger from his friends and associates. It feels very vacuous and a poor attempt to compile a biography. Third Chapter is again bits and pieces of information by Charlie.<br/><br/>Fourth Chapter is a compilation of his independent speeches and writing which has great nuggets of information! There are some generic advice splattered with good-to-great ones. Few things I liked:<br/><br/>1. Harvard commencement speech: Munger describes what should one do to be completely miserable in life. (Chemicals/drugs, envy, resentment, being unrealiable, learn everything you possibly can from your own personal experiences, minimizing objectivity, etc). I liked the negative approach of this delivery, since it creates a greater impression than a positive approach. Perhaps I will use this approach once.<br/><br/>https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/how-to-guarantee-a-life-of-misery-by-charlie-munger<br/><br/>2. Emphasis on mental models and understanding limitation of our cognitive apparatus<br/>https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/<br/><br/>3. Emphasis on scientific method: One specific line which captured my attention:<br/>""Most people early achieve and later intensify a tendency to process new and discomforting information so that any original conclusion remains intact.""<br/>He seems a fan of Darwin who ""gave priority attention to evidence tending to disconfirm whatever cherished and hard-won theory he already had"".<br/><br/>4. Great emphasis on understanding human psychology<br/> <br/>5. Advantages of micro-specialization,<br/>facets of microeconomics <br/>... and more.<br/><br/>Really enjoying the fourth chapter. If you have read similar books before there might not be a lot of new content; Though it seems a fun and easy read, a lot of overlap with generally sound advice and gives an insight into typical areas of focus for an investment professional.",,,1,0
